## Overview
In this lab exercise, you install **microclimate** in to your ICP Cluster, develop applications from scratch, and import existing applications.

### Configure ICP for Microclimate <a name="configure"></a>
In this section, you configure the environment for Microclimate.

#### Create Docker secret and patch service account

1. In a **terminal** session connected to your `master` node as the **root** user, run the following command to create a Docker registry secret in the default namespace:

   ```
   kubectl create secret docker-registry microclimate-registry-secret \
     --docker-server=mycluster.icp:8500 \
     --docker-username=admin \
     --docker-password=admin \
     --docker-email=null
   ```

2. Run the following command to patch the service account:

    ```
    kubectl patch serviceaccount default -p '{"imagePullSecrets": [{"name": "microclimate-registry-secret"}]}'
    ```

#### Create Helm secret

1. Run the following commands to login to ICP and initialize Helm:

    ```
    cd /root

    bx pr login -a https://<icp_master_ip>:8443 --skip-ssl-validation
    ```

2. Run the following command to create the Helm secret that is required by microclimate:

    ```
    kubectl create secret generic microclimate-helm-secret \
    --from-file=cert.pem=.helm/cert.pem \
    --from-file=ca.pem=.helm/ca.pem \
    --from-file=key.pem=.helm/key.pem
    ```


#### Create Persistant Volumes (PV) and Persistant Volume Claims (PVC)
Microclimate requires two PVCs to function: one to store workspace data, and another for Jenkins. The following steps walk you through the process of creating the PV and PVC.

**Note**: In this lab environment, the NFS Server is running on the icp-proxy node. In a *production* environment, a dedicated NFS Server will probably exist.

1. In a **terminal** session that is connected to your `proxy` node as the **root** user, run the following commands to create the directories that are mapped to the PV:

    ```
    cd /storage

    mkdir mc-workspace

    mkdir mc-jenkins

    chmod 777 mc*
    ```

**Note:** These are the only commands that you enter on the `proxy` node in this exercise. All subsequent commands are entered on the `master` node.

2. In a **terminal** session that is connected to your `master` node as the **root** user, copy the following PV definition in to a file named `mc-worspace-pv.yaml`, and change the **server IP address** (9.37.138.12) to the correct one for your environment.

    ```
    apiVersion: v1
    kind: PersistentVolume
    metadata:
      name: microclimate-workspace
    spec:
      accessModes:
        - ReadWriteOnce
      persistentVolumeReclaimPolicy: Retain
      capacity:
        storage: 2Gi
      nfs:
        path: /storage/mc-workspace
        server: 9.37.138.12
    ```

3. Copy the following PV definition in to a file named `mc-jenkins-pv.yaml`, and change the **server IP address** (9.37.138.12) to the correct one for your environment:

    ```
    apiVersion: v1
    kind: PersistentVolume
    metadata:
      name: microclimate-jenkins
    spec:
      accessModes:
        - ReadWriteOnce
      persistentVolumeReclaimPolicy: Retain
      capacity:
        storage: 8Gi
      nfs:
        path: /storage/mc-jenkins
        server: 9.37.138.12
    ```

4. Copy the following PVC definition in to a a file named `mc-worspace-pvc.yaml`:

    ```
   kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
   apiVersion: v1
   metadata:
     name: mc-workspace-pvc
   spec:
     accessModes:
       - ReadWriteOnce
     resources:
       requests:
         storage: 2Gi
    ```

5. Copy the following PVC definition in to a file named `mc-jenkins-pvc.yaml`:

    ```
   kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
   apiVersion: v1
   metadata:
     name: mc-jenkins-pvc
   spec:
     accessModes:
       - ReadWriteOnce
     resources:
       requests:
         storage: 8Gi
    ```

6. Create the Persistent Volumes, and Persistent Volume Claims by using the following commands:

   ```
   kubectl create -f ./mc-workspace-pv.yaml

   kubectl create -f ./mc-jenkins-pv.yaml

   kubectl create -f ./mc-worspace-pvc.yaml

   kubectl create -f ./mc-jenkins-pvc.yaml
   ```

7. Verify that the PVCs are successfully **Bound** to the PVs by running the following command:

`kubectl get pvc -n default`

```
# kubectl get pvc -n default
NAME               STATUS    VOLUME                 CAPACITY   ACCESS MODES   STORAGECLASS   AGE
mc-jenkins-pvc     Bound     microclimate-jenkins   8Gi        RWO                      1m
mc-workspace-pvc   Bound     mc-workspace           2Gi        RWO                     23s
```

### Deploy the Microclimate Helm Chart <a name="deploychart"></a>
In this section, you deploy the Microclimate Helm Chart by using the IBM Admin console.

1. Click **Catalog** from the ICP Admin Console menu bar to navigate to the Catalog of Helm Charts, and search for the `ibm-microclimate` chart.

2. Click the chart, read the overview, and then click **Configure**.

3. Enter the following information (accept the defaults for all other values), and click **Install**:

  | Parameter       | Value |
  | ------------- |-------------|
  | Release name  | microclimate |
  | Target namespace  | default (Note: must be default) |
  | I have read and agreed to the License Agreements | yes |

  In the **Persistence** section:

  | Parameter       | Value |
  | ------------- |-------------|
  | Existing PersistentVolumeClaim Name | mc-workspace-pvc |
  | Dynamic Provisioning | no |

  In the **Microclimate** section:
  **NOTE**: You must change the Jenkins hostname value to include your icp-proxy-ip address. For example, microclimate.9.37.138.12.nip.io.

  | Parameter       | Value |
  | ------------- |-------------|
  | Microclimate hostname | microclimate.icp-proxy-ip.nip.io |

  In the **Jenkins** section:
  **NOTE**: You must change the Jenkins hostname value to include your icp-proxy-ip address. For example, jenkins.9.37.138.12.nip.io.

  | Parameter       | Value |
  | ------------- |-------------|
  | Jenkins hostname | jenkins.icp-proxy-ip.nip.io |
  | Jenkins - Existing PersistentVolumeClaim Name | mc-jenkins-pvc |

5. You can monitor the status of your deployment from the CLI. Run the command, `kubectl get po`.

Note: It might take up to 5 minutes to get a **Running** status for all of the Microclimate pods.

```
# kubectl get po

NAME                                                    READY     STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
microclimate-ibm-microclimate-64cf96cc75-tlm6r          3/3       Running   0          6m
microclimate-ibm-microclimate-devops-86db55bd57-v76hd   1/1       Running   0          6m
microclimate-jenkins-56766f9b49-slxtw                   1/1       Running   0          6m
```

6. Once all the pods are running, you can open a browser tab and navigate to http://microclimate.icp-proxy-ip.nip.io. (Replace icp-proxy-ip with your ICP Proxy IP Address. For example, microclimate.9.37.138.12.nip.io.)

7. Read and accept the Microclimate license agreement, and click **Accept**.


### Import and test an example project in to Microclimate <a name="import"></a>
In this section, you import an example NodeJS microservice project in to Microclimate.

1. Select Import Project.

2. Enter "https://github.com/microclimate-demo/node" in the Git field, and click **Next**.

3. Verify that **Authentication required is not selected**, and click **Import**.

4. Once the project is imported, the **Microclimate Dashboard** displays. Click **Files**, as shown below, and open the **node** folder.

    ![Editor](images/microclimate/editor.jpg)

5. Using the File Viewer, open `/node/public` and `/node/server`, and review the source code for the sample application.

6. Open the `health` endpoint (`/node/server/routers/health.js`). Note that it simply replies with `status: UP` whenever invoked. Kubernetes uses this endpoint to determine whether the application is up and running, or not.

    ![Health](images/microclimate/health.jpg)

7. Open `/node/public/index.html`. Note that the page replies with a simple message. You change this message later in the lab exercise.

    ![Index](images/microclimate/index.jpg)

8. Open `/node/Dockerfile`. Note that the Dockerfile first uses package.json to define the dependencies, and later copies the application files in to the `/app` folder on the nodejs image.

    ![Dockerfile](images/microclimate/dockerfile.jpg)

9. Open `/node/Jenkinsfile`. Note that Jenkins uses the IBM provided and maintained `MicroserviceBuilder` library to handle the deployment.

    ![Jenkinsfile](images/microclimate/jenkinsfile.jpg)

10. By now, the sample application should be deployed and started by Microclimate, and the status in the top left of the screen shows as **Running**. If the status is still **Not running**, just wait a little longer.

    ![Application is running](images/microclimate/running.jpg)

11. Click **App Logs** to display the logs from the running container.

    ![Logs](images/microclimate/logs.jpg)

12. Click **Open app** to open the application in a new browser tab.

    ![Open App](images/microclimate/open_app1.jpg)

13. Close the browser tab, and return to the Microclimate dashboard. Click **Edit code**, and return to the `/node/public/index.html` file. Change the `Hello world! This is a StarterKit` line to a different value, and save your changes.

    ![New Index.html](images/microclimate/index2.jpg)

14. After a few seconds, you see the application status change to `Not running`, and then back to `Running` soon after. Microclimate deploys the change to ICP. Click **Open app**, and view your changes. Note that the Application URL changed to use a new Port.

    ![Open App](images/microclimate/open_app2.jpg)

15. Close the browser tab and return to the Microclimate dashboard. Click the **Run Load** button in the top right corner of the page to start a **Load Test**.

16. Click **App monitor** to open the application monitoring page. After a few seconds, requests start to be processed by the application, and show in the graphs. The load test runs for a short time.

    ![App Mon](images/microclimate/appmon.jpg)

15. Return to the **ICP Admin Console** and locate the **Deployment** and **Service** for your application. Note the **namespace** that they are deployed to.

### Create a Jenkins pipeline for the project <a name="jenkins"></a>

1. Return to the Microclimate Dashboard, and click **Pipeline**.

    ![Pipeline](images/microclimate/pipeline.jpg)

2. Click **Create pipeline**.

3. Enter https://github.com/microclimate-demo/node in the Repository location field.

4. Click **Create pipeline**.

5. You now see the message, "The pipeline has been configured for this project". Click **Open pipeline**.

6. If the ICP Admin Console login page displays, log in by using **admin/admin**.

7. Once logged in, you are routed to Jenkins, with a build in progress. Select the **Master** deployment.

7. Monitor the Stage view until the build is complete. There are three stages: Extract, Docker build, and Deploy. This might take up to 5 minutes to complete.

    ![Jenkins Deploy](images/microclimate/jenkins-deploy.jpg)

8. Once the build process has completed, return to the ICP Admin Console and locate the newly created **Deployment** and **Service**. Note the different namespace.

9. Use the **Launch** button on the new Deployment to open a browser tab to the application.

10. Close the browser tabs for the **application** and the **Microclimate Dashboard**.
